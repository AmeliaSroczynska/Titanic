# Titanic Machine Learning Project

## Description
Classic machine learning beginner-level project on the Titanic dataset. This project is designed to be run as a Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- PassengerId: Unique passenger identifier
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Name: Passenger name
- Sex: Gender
- Age: Age in years
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
 
## How to Use in Google Colab
1. Upload notebook to your Google Drive or open it directly in Google Colab.
2. Upload the Titanic dataset files.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. The notebook includes both code cells and markdown cells explaining every step to help understand the workflow.

## Results
Model performance metrics are displayed inside the notebook with visualizations and explanations.
